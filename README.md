## What is Realm Unlimited?
Realm Unlimited is a health and wellness startup consulting company founded by Kara Hirdman and Krystal Queen. Their mission statement is “To educate current and future leaders in the use of best practices and strategies to create happy and healthy cultures.” 

Realm and Unlimited’s main goals include:
- Organizational Leadership Development and bringing wellness to all on a dynamic level
- To provide the education, resources and tools to exemplify Equity, Diversity & Inclusion
- Working with all levels of employees to give them the education, resources and development to achieve their own goals to become the best version of themselves

## Application Overview
When Realm Unlimited started, courses were taught in person out of a workbook. With COVID-19, Realm Unlimited approached us to take their teachings to the web. In an effort to reach both current and prospective audiences, we developed a mobile-friendly education platform called Unique for our client. 

Unique contains a mobile-first side for users, where users can learn about Realm Unlimited’s eight realms of wellness:
- Emotional Health and Wellness
- Nutritional Health and Wellness
- Physical Health and Wellness
- Spiritual Health and Wellness
- Financial Health and Wellness
- Environmental Health and Wellness
- Social Health and Wellness
- and Intellectual Health and Wellness

For the user side, a user is able to login to the platform and see each of the eight realms. They can choose to take a realm course, where they will be prompted to fill out a preliminary form to gather their prior knowledge on the specific realm of wellness. Afterwards, they will be taken to course content, which can include videos, text resources, and images as our clients see fit.

The other side to this application is the desktop-first admin platform, where our client can edit the course curriculum as needed. An administrator is able to login to this portion of the application through user authentication and see a similar view of what a “regular” user can see. They have access to the same eight realms as said user, but also have menu links at the top right corner of the page. These menu links can take an administrator to view “Realms,” “Sections,” or “Statistics” as needed. 

In “Realms,” an administrator can view all realms, or courses, in their system. They can view the realms to see what has been included in each, and delete them from their database should they need to. By clicking on “+ New Realm,” an administrator can create a new realm. The process of creating a new realm includes a form to record the realm name, cover photo, and realm description. Cover photos can be previewed with the eye icon next to the input field. Next, an administrator can select the sections, or lessons, they want to include in the realm on the following view. Finally, they can save the information and post the new realm into their database for their users to then explore.

In “Sections,” an administrator can similarly see all sections, or lessons, in their system. Sections can be viewed, with their type marked by a video, text or image icon. They can also be added and deleted if necessary. By clicking “+ New Section,” a user can post a new text, image or video section. Youtube and Ted Talk videos are supported. Edits can also be made to sections, as all updates will be reflected in the database.

Finally, in “Statistics,” a minimalistic page holds three buttons that will download CSV (spreadsheet) files of their prospective data: “Curriculum” information, “Demographics” of the users, and “Feedback” from general user input. These have all been provided so that the client can better understand who they’re serving.
